- Cohen's kappa: 0.78 (substantial agreement)

Conclusion: The AI system demonstrates substantial agreement with radiologist consensus, meeting pre-specified performance criteria for clinical use as a screening tool.

Limitations:
- Validation on single dataset (NIH ChestX-ray14)
- Limited representation of rare pathologies
- Performance may vary with different imaging equipment

Recommendations:
- Use as a first-line screening tool
- All positive findings should be confirmed by radiologist
- Monitor real-world performance with ongoing data collection
